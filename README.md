<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Hello Rails Front-End <a name="about-project"></a>



**Hello Rails Front-End** is a tutorial exercise project that focuses on the integration of React with Rails. It demonstrates how to connect the front-end with the back-end by consuming greetings data from the Rails API and rendering it in the user interface using React components. By following this tutorial, developers can gain a better understanding of how to integrate React and Rails, enabling them to build interactive and dynamic applications that leverage the strengths of both technologies. The project provides a practical example of how to establish this integration, serving as a guide for developers looking to implement similar functionality in their own projects.
